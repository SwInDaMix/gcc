# Tool to measure AC load characteristic
It is a simple an useful in practice tool to investigate how a particular AC load behaves. The tool measures voltage, frequency, apparent, active and effective powers, **cos** Ï†. It also measure the overall power taken or given (reverse) to or from AC load.

## Under construction :construction:
The project is not finished. There also will be a PC software ([GitHub](https://github.com/SwInDaMix/sw-hub/tree/master/CS/DevTool_ACPowerMetter))
