# Custom firmware for S12S e-bike controller
The idea to make this firmware is to support popular e-bike controllers like S06S and S12S.

**Sinusoidal Commutation in the Real World: The Phase-to-Phase Method**

Pure sinusoidal drive voltages sound great in theory, but are rarely used in practical designs because theyâ€™re inefficient to generate for each motor winding with respect to ground. The preferred approach  is to generate three sinusoidal voltages *between* the three phases. This is done by varying the PWM duty cycle (and hence drive voltages) relative to ground using the characteristic profile in *figure below*, rather than a pure sinusoid. When any phase is measured with respect to ground, the waveform is sinusoidally coupled with third-order harmonics; the phase current driving the motor follows the pure sine-wave profile of the phase-to-phase voltage.
