# Safe Code Lock
I have a safe (I don't tell you where :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) it can only apply a 6 digits code, not more, not less. I want it to be more flexible in that.

So i disassembled it and found this

Now it can apply from 3 to 10 digits as a password. In idle mode is consumes from a 6LR61 battery less then 3 uA. Currently it running a lot of tests on reliability (I don't want to get a stuck and locked safe mounted in a concrete wall :smile:)
